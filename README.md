# Kyanbasu

A new way for uploading and sharing images with your friends!

## About

Kyanbasu is a personal project built using Node.js (Meteor in particular) for the backend related stuff while leveraging React and Flow-Router for seamless transitions and state updates. For right now, the project is still with the barebones infancy stage. But I'm hoping to have a working prototype live by the end of April 2017
